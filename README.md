1.We have to go through the STM 32 discovery and all its performance analysis along with its IDE, cube programmer, ST-link utility.
We have to learn about pn sequence generation on both matlab and visual studio code by using c programming.
We have to learn how to scrambell and descrambell the image or waveform along with auto corellation and cross corellation functions(which are predefined on matlab)
Briefly study LFSR sequence, pseudo noise, bitwise operation in c
